# README

I started building this site to try and "re-learn" ruby and Ruby on Rails (5) after some time I wasn't working with it.

But at some point I came to realize that I don't want to jump on this ruby train again and chosen different stack for my carreer (JS, Elixir). So sorry, this is just a torso of what it should be.

It runs on free Heroku instance, so sorry for long loading times.

You can find more about me at [Calmer.co]("www.calmer.co")</a>.
